    "### Example 1: Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "**Problem**: Some users have only rated a few movies, making it difficult to find similar users for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Solution**: \n",
    "To address the cold start problem for users, we can implement a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with content-based filtering. Initially, we use content-based recommendations based on the genres, directors, and actors of the movies that the user has rated. As the user interacts with more movies, we gradually incorporate collaborative filtering."

    "\n",
    "**Proposed Solution**: \n",
    "To promote diversity and avoid over-recommending popular items, we can introduce a popularity penalty or use a diversified recommendation algorithm. One approach is to use a modified version of collaborative filtering that includes a diversity term in the objective function, encouraging the recommendation of less popular items alongside popular ones."

    "To handle the sparsity of reviews for some restaurants, we can use a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering with a knowledge-based recommendation system. The knowledge-based system can leverage the attributes of restaurants, such as cuisine type, location, and price range, to recommend lesser-known restaurants that match the userâ€™s preferences."
