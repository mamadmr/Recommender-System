# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering

### Overview
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/) dataset. The system is designed to provide movie recommendations that users will enjoy, keeping them engaged with the platform. The project involves two main tasks:

### Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based with Cosine Similarity): 
Recommend movies based on usersâ€™ rating history without using any pre-built libraries.
### Content-Based Filtering: 
Utilize film metadata such as genre, year, and director to recommend movies based on users' preference history.
Dataset

### The MovieLens dataset includes:

This data set consists of:
* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
    * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
