# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering

### Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The system is designed to provide movie recommendations that users will enjoy, keeping them engaged with the platform. The project involves two main tasks:

### Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based with Cosine Similarity): 
Recommend movies based on usersâ€™ rating history without using any pre-built libraries.
### Content-Based Filtering: 
Utilize film metadata such as genre, year, and director to recommend movies based on users' preference history.
Dataset

### The MovieLens dataset includes:

100,000 movie ratings provided by 943 users for 1682 movies.
Demographic information about users, such as age, gender, and occupation.
